Welcome to the future of project management. ODUS is designed to minimize administrative overhead by leveraging AI to do the heavy lifting.

## Quick Start

1.  **Launch the System**: You will be greeted by the cinematic **Landing Console**. Click "INITIALIZE SYSTEM" to boot the workspace.
2.  **Create a Project**:
    *   Click the `+` button in the sidebar or "Initialize ODUS" on the dashboard.
    *   **Prompt**: "Create a marketing plan for a Q4 SaaS launch."
    *   **Watch**: ODUS will generate tasks, dates, and priorities automatically, assigning a unique **Neon Identity** to the project.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Dashboard
Your central command center.
-   **Founder's Focus:** A curated list of high-priority tasks.
    -   **Color Coding:** Tasks are now color-coded by their parent project's neon identity (Cyan, Magenta, Lime, etc.) for instant context switching.
    -   **Completion:** Click the circular check button to mark tasks done without leaving the dashboard.
    -   **AI Curation:** Click **Curate (AI)** to have Gemini analyze all projects and repopulate this list with the top 5 critical items.
-   **Smart Add:** Type "Fix login bug in Auth Service" in the top-right input.
    -   *Dual Action:* This creates a task in the relevant project AND creates a node in your Mind Map for future brainstorming.

### 2. Project Views
Switch between views using the toggle in the project header:
-   **Kanban:** Standard Drag-and-Drop with "Smart Sort".
-   **Gantt:** Timeline view for scheduling and visual overlap detection.
-   **Node Graph:** A physics-based view of task dependencies using D3.js.

### 3. The Data Vault
A local-first file storage system.
-   Drag and drop files anywhere on the screen to upload.
-   Link files to specific tasks in the Task Detail view.
-   *Privacy:* Files are stored in your browser's IndexedDB, not on a cloud server.

### 4. Neural Mind Board
A space for unstructured thinking.
-   **Neural Ingestion:** Items added via the Dashboard's "Smart Add" automatically appear here as nodes.
-   **AI Connections:** The system analyzes your text to automatically link related concepts.

### 5. Voice Agent
Click the floating circle in the bottom right to activate **ODUS Agent**.
-   **Commands:** "Create a task to buy servers", "Show me the calendar", "Create a note about pricing".
-   **Voice:** Click the mic icon to speak naturally.
