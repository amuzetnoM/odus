Welcome to the future of project management. ODUS is designed to minimize administrative overhead by leveraging AI to do the heavy lifting.

## Quick Start

1.  **Launch the System**: Click "INITIALIZE SYSTEM" on the landing console.
2.  **AI Initialization**: Use the `+` button to prompt the AI: "Create a SaaS launch plan."
3.  **Explore**: The system will generate a project board, timeline, and dependency graph.

## New in v1.3: Interface Customization

ODUS now adapts to your preferences.
1.  **Open Settings**: Click the "Config" button in the sidebar.
2.  **Interface Tab**:
    *   **Theme Mode**: Switch between **Dark** (Cyberpunk/Default) and **Light** (Clean/Professional).
    *   **System Accent**: Choose your primary neon color (Cyan, Indigo, Rose, etc.).
    *   **Sidebar**: Adjust the width of the navigation pane or use the drag handle on the sidebar edge.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Dashboard (Scope)
-   **Success Roadmap**: The right-hand panel visualizes your "Optimal Delivery Vector"—a computed path of high-priority tasks leading to project completion.
-   **Smart Add**: Type "Fix login bug" -> AI routes it to the correct project automatically.

### 2. System Status (Telemetry)
-   The sidebar is now cleaner. Detailed metrics (Health, Focus Load, Critical Count) are hidden in a **Slide-Up Panel**.
-   **Access**: Click the "System Status" bar at the bottom of the sidebar to reveal real-time analytics.

### 3. Zen Mode
-   Feeling overwhelmed? Click **Zen Mode** in the sidebar.
-   Enter a physics-based particle playground designed to reset your focus. Move your mouse to interact with the digital flow.

### 4. The AI Agent
-   **Floating Interface**: The agent lives in a floating bubble. You can drag it and "throw" it across the screen—physics handles the rest.
-   **Capabilities**: Ask it to "Create a CSV file for budget" or "Delete the marketing project".

### 5. Neural Mind Board
-   **Dual Entry**: Double-click to add nodes manually, or use Smart Add.
-   **Markdown**: Click any node to open the immersive, distraction-free text editor.
