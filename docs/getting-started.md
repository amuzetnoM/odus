# Getting Started with ODUS

Welcome to the future of project management. ODUS is designed to minimize administrative overhead by leveraging AI to do the heavy lifting.

## Quick Start

1.  **Launch the App**: Navigate to the [Live Application](https://odus-ai-project-manager-937668381187.us-west1.run.app).
2.  **Initialize**:
    *   Click the `+` button in the sidebar or "Initialize ODUS" on the dashboard.
    *   **Prompt**: "Create a marketing plan for a Q4 SaaS launch."
    *   **Watch**: ODUS will generate tasks, dates, and priorities automatically.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Dashboard
Your central command center.
-   **Founder's Focus:** A curated list of high-priority tasks. Use the **Curate (AI)** button to have Gemini analyze all your projects and pick the top 5 most critical items.
-   **Smart Add:** Type "Fix login bug in Auth Service" in the top-right input. ODUS will automatically find the "Auth Service" project and add the task there.

### 2. Project Views
Switch between views using the toggle in the project header:
-   **Kanban:** Standard Drag-and-Drop.
-   **Gantt:** Timeline view for scheduling.
-   **Node Graph:** A physics-based view of task dependencies. Use this to spot bottlenecks.

### 3. The Data Vault
A local-first file storage system.
-   Drag and drop files anywhere on the screen to upload.
-   Link files to specific tasks in the Task Detail view.

### 4. Voice Agent
Click the floating circle in the bottom right to activate **ODUS Agent**.
-   **Commands:** "Create a task to buy servers", "Show me the calendar", "Create a note about pricing".
-   **Voice:** Click the mic icon to speak naturally.
